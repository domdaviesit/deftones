        <h3>Album Update</h3>
        <p>Deftones give update on “powerful” sounding new album.</p>
        <p>Deftones have revealed that they have “six or seven” new songs written and in progress for their upcoming album.
          The band’s previous release was their acclaimed 2016 album ‘Gore‘. Having previously told us that he ‘wouldn’t
          want to carry on forever‘, the band then excited fans by sharing photos of them “back at it” and “jamming” in the
          studio earlier this year.</p>

        <h3>The debut edition of the Dia de los Deftones</h3>
        <p>The Deftones only have two gigs planned for California this year, and one of them is happening at Petco Park on November
          3. The debut edition of the Dia de los Deftones festival promises food, drink, craft beer, and a full slate of
          music acts ranging from hip-hop to pop, punk, and death metal. “For years, we’ve played on festivals with such
          amazing and diverse lineups,” says Deftones singer-guitarist Chino Moreno on the band’s website, “and that is what
          we have achieved with our first lineup for Dia de Los Deftones. We want this event to be a celebration; with the
          incredible artists we’ve assembled, and the experiences we’re curating for the festival site.”</p>
